# CorrelationGene 0.1.0

CorrelationGene is a small R package that takes any Seurat object, gene of interest and gene list and calculates the Pearson correlations between the identities specified by the user. 

Please raise any issues through Github or email me at timothy.james.allen@ki.se for questions/issues/contributions! 

# Future functions

*Take multiple genes of interests
*Further statistical functions on the correlations i.e. T test, Shapiro-test, FDR
*Statistical tests for differences in correlation matrices
*Make a vignette!
